## 🎉 Impact

### Accuracy Improvement
The TODO.md now accurately reflects the **actual state** of the project rather than outdated assumptions.

### Morale Boost
Team can see that critical work is **already complete** rather than thinking it's all "Not Started".

### Clear Direction
Updated priorities show **realistic next steps** rather than redundant work.

### Documentation Trail
Added references to comprehensive status reports:
- `CRITICAL_PHASE_STATUS_REPORT.md`
- `COMPLETE_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `SECURITY_TESTS_SUMMARY.md`
- `SCROLL_PACKAGE_TEST_EXPANSION.md`
- `E2E_TESTS_SUMMARY.md`

## 🔍 What Didn't Change

Preserved all original content for:
- Version strategy discussion
- Phase 3-10 detailed plans
- Package documentation templates
- Tool configuration examples
- Success metrics definitions
- Project vision and values

Only updated **status markers** and **completion states**, not the original plans.
