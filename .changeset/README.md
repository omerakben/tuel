# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Creating a Changeset

To create a new changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the version bump type (major, minor, patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

## Changeset Files

Changeset files are markdown files with YAML front matter that describe:
- Which packages are being changed
- The type of version bump for each package
- A description of the changes for the changelog

Example changeset file:

```markdown
---
"@tuel/scroll": minor
"@tuel/motion": patch
---

Added new horizontal scroll animation component with performance optimizations
```

## Releasing Packages

Releases are handled automatically via GitHub Actions when changesets are merged to main.
