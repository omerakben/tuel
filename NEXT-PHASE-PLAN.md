- Visual regression testing
- Performance regression testing
```

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features** üöÄ *NEXT 2-4 WEEKS*

#### 3.1 Advanced Animation Patterns

```bash
# Extend beyond basic migration
- Complex animation sequences
- Physics-based animations
- Advanced gesture recognition
- WebGL integration patterns
```

#### 3.2 Performance Optimization

```bash
# Next-level performance features
- Automatic optimization recommendations
- Bundle splitting strategies

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Action Items

### **This Week (High Priority)**

1. **Integration Test with Real Project**

   ```bash
   # Pick one CodeGrid project for integration
   cd ../your-codegrid-project
   npm install @tuel/performance @tuel/config
   # Test actual usage patterns
   ```

2. **Performance Baseline**

   ```bash
   # Measure current performance
   npm run build -- --analyze
   # Compare bundle sizes before/after
   ```

3. **Documentation Sprint**

   ```bash
   # Create essential docs
   - README.md for each package
   - Usage examples
   - API reference
   ```

### **Next Week (Medium Priority)**

4. **Developer Experience**

   ```bash
   # Improve DX
   - Create development helpers
   - Add debug utilities
   - Optimize TypeScript performance
   ```

5. **Testing Foundation**

   ```bash
   # Set up testing infrastructure
   - Jest configuration
   - Testing utilities
   - CI/CD integration
   ```

6. **Real-World Validation**

   ```bash
   # Validate with complex scenarios
   - High-animation projects
   - Mobile performance
   - Accessibility testing
   ```

## ü§î Decision Points & Questions

### **Architecture Decisions**

1. **Monorepo vs. Separate Repos**: Continue with monorepo or split?
2. **Release Strategy**: Independent versioning or synchronized releases?
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: How to handle breaking changes?

### **Team Coordination**

1. **Adoption Timeline**: Gradual rollout vs. big bang migration?
2. **Training Needs**: Team education on new patterns?
3. **Support Model**: How to handle issues and questions?

### **Technology Choices**

1. **Testing Framework**: Jest, Vitest, or alternatives?
2. **Documentation**: Storybook, Docusaurus, or custom?
3. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, other providers?

## üéä Recommendation: Start with Phase 1.1

**Immediate Next Step:** Choose one moderately complex CodeGrid project and integrate the TUEL packages to validate real-world usage. This will:

1. **Validate the migration** with actual use cases
2. **Identify any missing functionality** early
3. **Provide concrete feedback** for improvements
4. **Build confidence** in the new system

Would you like me to help you:

- **Set up integration testing** with a specific CodeGrid project?
- **Create comprehensive documentation** for the packages?
- **Build development tools** to improve the developer experience?
- **Establish testing infrastructure** for long-term maintenance?
