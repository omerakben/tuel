# ✅ TUEL Versioning Strategy & Autonomous Execution - READY

**Date**: January 11, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR AUTONOMOUS COPILOT EXECUTION**
**Version Path**: v1.1.2 → v2.0.0
**Timeline**: 22 weeks (Jan 2025 → June 2025)

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Version Strategy Added to TODO.md

**Added Section**: "⚠️ CRITICAL: VERSION STRATEGY FIX" at the top of TODO.md

**Content includes**:

- Problem statement (incorrect v1.x release for pre-stable code)
- Impact analysis (misleading production-ready signal)
- 3 solution options with recommendations
- Semantic versioning explanation (0.x vs 1.x vs 2.x)
- Current version audit (inconsistencies found)
- Target version scheme (0.x pre-production, 1.x stable, 2.x breaking changes)
- Version alignment tasks
- Changesets configuration
- Migration strategy from v1.1.2 → v2.0.0

**Recommendation**: **Option 2** - Continue with v1.x → v2.0.0 path

- Accept v1.1.2 as published (don't deprecate)
- Fix all critical issues
- Release v2.0.0 as "First Production-Ready Release"
- Include clear migration guide and breaking changes documentation

## 🚀 How to Start Autonomous Execution

### For GitHub Copilot Agent

**Step 1**: Read the quick start guide

```bash
cat /Users/ozzy-mac/Projects/tuel/QUICK_START_COPILOT.md
```

**Step 2**: Run pre-flight checklist

```bash
cd /Users/ozzy-mac/Projects/tuel
node --version  # Verify Node.js
pnpm --version  # Verify pnpm
pnpm install    # Install dependencies
```

**Step 3**: Start with Phase 0

```bash
# Run version audit
node scripts/audit-versions.js

# Create development branch
git checkout -b develop
git checkout -b copilot/autonomous-improvement

# Follow Phase 0 tasks in QUICK_START_COPILOT.md
```

**Step 4**: Follow the plan

- Execute tasks sequentially from TODO.md
- Validate after each phase with `./scripts/validate-phase.sh`
- Update PROGRESS.md as tasks complete
- Provide status updates every 10 tasks

---

### For Human Supervision

**Monitor progress**:

```bash
# Check current status
cat PROGRESS.md | head -20

# View recent updates
cat PROGRESS.md | grep "Recent Updates" -A 10

# See current git branch
git branch --show-current

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10
```

**Key files to watch**:

- `PROGRESS.md` - Overall completion status
- `git log` - Commit messages show what's being worked on
- Package files - Security fixes and improvements

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Version Strategy: Continue v1.x → v2.0.0 (Option 2)

**Rationale**:

- Less disruptive than deprecating v1.x
- Clear communication that v2.0.0 is first production-ready
- Breaking changes justified by security fixes
- Industry-standard approach (many libraries do this)

**Implementation**:

- Accept v1.1.2 as historical release
- Fix all issues in v2.0.0-alpha.x releases
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Provide migration guide
- Mark v2.0.0 as "First Production-Ready Release"

---

### 2. Repository Structure: Keep Separate (tuel + tuel-demo)

**Rationale**:

- Library (tuel) stays focused and lightweight
- Examples (tuel-demo) can evolve independently
- Better for npm distribution
- Clearer for contributors
- Recommended best practice for libraries

---

### 3. Autonomous Execution: Enabled with Guardrails

**Autonomous operations (no approval needed)**:

- Code fixes (security, performance, bugs)
- Test writing
- Documentation updates
- Dependency updates (minor/patch)
- Refactoring within modules

**Require approval**:

- Publishing to npm (final release)
- Major architectural changes (removing packages)
- Breaking changes to public API
- Major dependency updates

---
